# PiTV for Raspberry Pi (DEVELOP-1.0.0)

**This is a work-in-progress branch for the upcoming version 1.0.0 using Angular.js. It is far from complete and currently unusable! Check out the master branch for the fully functional software.**

This turns your Pi into a Popcorntime-like set-top box. The Pi will be able to stream movies and series from torrents and play it on a connected HDMI screen (preferable a TV).

On a running PiTV you can open a remote in your browser by navigating to your Pi's IP.
